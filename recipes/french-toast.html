        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>1 egg </li>
                <li>¾ cup heavy cream </li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract </li>
                <li>Zest of ½ orange</li>
                <li>A pinch of grated nutmeg </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Cognac </li>
                <li>2 slices of thick-cut bread (Pullman, challah, or brioche)</li>
                <li>2 slices of thick-cut bread (Pullman, challah, or brioche)</li>
                <li>3-4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>Optional: Whipped salted butter and powdered sugar for topping</li>
              
            </ul>        

        <h1>Directions</h1>
            <ol>
               <li>In a medium bowl, beat together the egg, cream, 
                orange zest, vanilla, nutmeg, Cognac, and salt, 
                whisking until fully incorporated. Soak the bread 
                for 2-3 minutes per side (or longer if desired).</li>
               <li>Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat, 
                swirling it around to coat the bottom of the pan. 
                Add the bread slices and adjust the heat if you notice 
                the bread browning too fast. Once one side has cooked 
                for about a minute, flip and sprinkle a pinch of 
                granulated sugar over the browned crust. Repeat on 
                the other side, allowing the sugared sides to caramelize 
                in the pan for 30 seconds to a minute more, adding 
                more butter if needed.</li>
               <li>Finally, plate the slices with powdered sugar and 
                a dollop of whipped butter. Finish it off with maple 
                syrup, and your 5-star (maybe even 6-star!) French toast 
                breakfast is served.</li>
