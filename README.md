make a basic website to display a recipe

i will make a basic website using the fundamentals that I have learned so far from TOP (the odin project). this will consist of the basics of HTML, Git, Github and Bash command shell.
use basic command line functions to navigate and create new files as needed.
create html boilerplate
use lists headings and images to create the website 
upload to github at relevant stages
Commit every time there is a meaningful change in the code.
